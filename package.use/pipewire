# To use PipeWire as a sound server, specify the sound-server USE flag on media-video/pipewire[1].
# Then, if using PipeWire as a replacement for the PulseAudio sound server:
#
# 1. Ensure media-sound/pulseaudio-daemon is not installed. This is necessary to avoid issues resulting from running more than one sound server.
# 2. Ensure media-libs/libpulse is installed, which will allow PipeWire to emulate a PulseAudio sound server. Not many applications currently support PipeWire's native API.
# 3. Ensure the pulseaudio USE flag is still set globally.

### Deps - libsdl2 USE "wayland" needs "gles2"
